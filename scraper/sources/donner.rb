  # look for a string inside of it. This is also why we're not using the same json above, which would
  # contain all the fields we'd need.
  # One downside is that they only mark books is InStock or SoldOut, even when a different status would be
  # relevant, such as back-orders or pre-orders. So Unfortunately it's all or nothing.
